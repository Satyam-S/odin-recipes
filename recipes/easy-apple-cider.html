    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>This apple cider recipe is super easy to make. I used to buy the spices already mixed at the grocery store, and they stopped carrying them, so I just made my own. Great for a shower or get-together, and the slow cooker keeps it warm so guests can enjoy it through the night! Serve with a slice of orange, and add spiced rum, if desired.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (64 fluid ounce) bottle apple cider</li>
        <li>3 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole allspice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole cloves</li>
        <li>â…“ cup brown sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Combine apple cider and cinnamon sticks in a slow cooker.</li>
    <li>Place allspice and cloves onto the center of an 8-inch square piece of cheesecloth.</li>
    <li>Gather edges of the cheesecloth together and tie to secure; place in the slow cooker.</li>
    <li>Stir in brown sugar. Cook on High until it comes to a boil.</li> 
    <li>Reduce heat to Low and keep warm.</li>
</ol>
